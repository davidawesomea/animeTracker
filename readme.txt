After building, run Create.exe to create a profile for any anime/tv series you are watching, will be watching, or have watched.
After you have done that you can run Tracker.exe and start using the tracker! Note: if you accidentally press the +1 button you must manually change the value in that show's profile file.

To create a background for the tracker, resize/crop an image to fit then rename it to bg.png and place it in the root directory of the program. Note: it must be a png file.
To fill the entire background of the program it must be at least 300x350. It is recommended to get as close to this resolution as possible without going under.
